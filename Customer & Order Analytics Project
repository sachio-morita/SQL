#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT orderid) 
FROM JanSales 
WHERE 
product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT 
DISTINCT cust.acctnum 
FROM customers Cust
JOIN FebSales Feb 
ON Feb.OrderId = Cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT 
DISTINCT product, MIN(price) AS Price 
From FebSales
GROUP BY product 
ORDER BY price 
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT 
Product, 
SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product; 

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
Product, 
SUM(quantity), 
SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
